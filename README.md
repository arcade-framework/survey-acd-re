# Survey on Assurance Case Development and Requirements Engineering

Dear survey participant,  

Thank you very much for sparing 15 minutes of your time to answer our questionnaire. We are researchers investigating how requirements engineering and assurance case development are intertwined in the development of safety-critical systems. The results of this survey will help us understand how these two areas are current integrated and what are the opinions of professionals towards its integration. This survey is anonymous.

For further information / questions, please contact:
* Msc. Camilo Almendra at cca3@cin.ufpe.br (primary contact - Universidade Federal de Pernambuco/Brazil)
* Dr. Carla Silva (supporting scientist - Universidade Federal de Pernambuco/Brazil)
* Dr. Luiz Eduardo Martins (supporting scientist - Universidade Federal de São Paulo/Brazil)
* Dr. Johnny Marques (supporting scientist - Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica/Brazil)

## Survey Principles and Participation

Please note that the survey is completely anonymous and we apply the highest academic standards along with the data collection and data analysis. Further, all researchers are committed to open science practices which means that we will disclose the data collected afterward to the public; however, before disclosing research data, we will sanitise and anonymize it further in case we see specific entries that might allow to trace back the responses given to a specific organizational setting. Finally, we will ask you a series of specific questions directed at your experiences made in your development team than in your organization. That is, if not stated otherwise, please refer to your experiences in your most recent software development iteration. 

## Structure of the survey

The survey includes several questions structured into the following categories:  
* Professional Profile
* Organization and Projects
* Requirements Engineering Practices
* Assurance Case Development Practices
* Integrated Development Practices
* Personal Opinion on Integrated Development

At the end, you will be asked to enter your email address on a voluntary basis. Provided you agree, we will use that address to latter provide you with an overview of the survey results. In any case, please rest assured that the survey follows a high academic standard and is conducted anonymously, and the address will be removed from the data set during the export so that no association with your answers will be possible.
